# Web and multimedia applications developer 

I am looking for an opportunity to grow as a frontend developer (also open to backend or fullstack tasks). I am confident with React (Turbopack/Next/Redux/Zustand), JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, PHP. Open to remote work or local opportunities.  
I hold a relevant degree; my graduation project was a full-stack solution (React, Express, MongoDB, Figma) which I defended with honors. I also passed a state demo exam (PHP full-stack) with an almost maximum score — 78 out of 80.
My stack: TypeScript/JavaScript; HTML5; CSS3; PHP; PHP Composer; VueJS; ReactJS; NextJS; Redux; Zustand; Tailwind; MongoDB; MySQL; Bootstrap; REST API; Node.js; Git; GitHub; Figma; Responsive design; BEM; OOP.
